  <h3>Current Project</h3>
  <p class='projects'>Right now I'm pretty busy working on a handful of mobile projects for the Yale Student Developers. We essentially have only two designers split among way too many projects, and I'm handling <em>everything</em> mobile, so I'm swamped! Sometimes I write about these projects or other designy thoughts that occur to me in the day, and you'll find those among the <a href="http://inmannheim.wordpress.com/category/design/user-experience/">UX design posts on my blog</a>.</p>
  <p class='projects'>For the holidays: a new personal/portfolio website with blog integration - long overdue!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Reddit Thingimajig</h3>
  <p class='projects'>I managed a project with two developers and one nontechnical member, creating a web app that gave you information about <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>
  from a more social perspective than the usual Reddit statistics websites. I developed personas, helped us turn disparate initial ideas into a working spec
  with clearly defined features, created a schedule that worked with the extremely busy end-of-semester period and learning technologies that we were not familiar with, organized project meetings and kept us on track, and designed and developed the front-end. Due to time and API limitations,
  we didn't get to implement everything we wanted, but we had some good ideas and I'm happy with what we thought of.</p>
  <p>Try it <a href="http://reddit.jessicayang.org">here</a>! (It might be currently broken, though. But you get the gist.) </p>

  <h3>Phishing Trip</h3>
  <p>I spearheaded a project that won <strong>first runner-up</strong> at the Google 24 Hours of Good 2014 hackathon. I came up with the initial idea, led the team through refining the vision through brainstorming sessions and user flow walkthroughs, then drew up a task list and schedule for the project and delegated accordingly. I also coded front-end, as I usually do on projects.</p><p>
  We managed to forget to take screenshots or save our final pitch (24 hours is a long time to go without rest), but here is a
 mockup I made early in the process while we were defining features, and an illustration I did for the final UI. People liked it a lot.</p>

  <h3>Shot Roulette</h3>
  <p class='projects'>My first hackathon, in a mixed-ability team of two developers and two very nontechnical people. I conceptualized and created the front end for our Y-Hack 2013 entry. Apart from
  writing front-end code, I also did wireframing and created personas and user flows, to narrow down the feature set we needed to implement
  while making the app more engaging. I attempted to delegate in a way such that our nontechnical members would have a learning experience through
  the hackathon. We didn't win anything, but those who stopped
  by our table really enjoyed playing with the tool, and often remarked on how good it looked.</p>

  <h3>Wedding Informant</h3>
  <p>I designed and developed the front end for a startup's web app. This was shortly after I read several books on user experience design,
  and marks the first time I used Balsamiq for wireframes.</p>

  <h3>Flight Simulator IOS</h3>
  <p>I designed and developed the front end to a web-based instructor/operator station for a military flight simulator,
      relying heavily on jQuery and the Openlayers mapping library.</p>
