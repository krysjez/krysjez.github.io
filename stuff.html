        <h3>Art</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I like illustration and comics, in case you couldn't tell. I'm also fond of, but less good at, calligraphy and large outdoor installations/public art.</li>
          <li><em>Favorite artists</em>: <a href="http://jamesgurney.com">James Gurney</a>, Olafur Eliasson, <a href="http://alexandermcqueen.com">Alexander McQueen</a>, <a href="http://donatoart.com">Donato Giancola</a>, <a href="http://petarmeseldzijaart.com">Petar Meseld&#382;ija</a>, Vincent van Gogh, Mona Hatoum, <a href="http://phobs.deviantart.com/">Phobs</a>, <a href="http://paulduffield.co.uk">Paul Duffield</a>, <a href="http://ashen-ray.com">Shilin</a>.
        </ul>
<br> 
        <h3>Travel/Favorite Cities</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>My travel style usually involves visiting museums, parks, and a lot of walking/cycling and city exploration.</li>
            <li><em>Singapore</em>: I say this as unbiasedly as I can be, after having been to many places.</li>
            <li><em>Aarhus, Denmark</em>: a charming city that comes with many of my favorite things - bicycles, nice parks, a museum with at least two great Olafur Eliasson pieces, and <i>the sea</i>: I'm in love. (I've only been there in the summer, though. I'd very much like to live there for a little longer.)</li>
            <li><em>Pittenweem, Scotland</em>: not a city; a tiny, tiny village really. It's very beautiful in the summer and has a sweet shop that sells the most delicious tablet. Also on the sea, which adds 100 points in my book.</li>
            <li><em>New York City, USA</em>: a very different kind of city from Singapore, and the closest I can feel to home in this corner of the States. Manhattan is on the sea, I guess.</li>
            <li><em>Taipei, Taiwan</em>: an interesting blend of old and new; it felt a little like the Singapore of my early childhood. Also on an island! I think we're starting to see a trend here.</li>
            <li><em>Hangzhou/Suzhou, China</em>: a rarity: a mainland Chinese city I feel at ease in.</li>
        </ul>
<br>

        <h3>Books and Comics</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>I keep track of reading on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/krysjez">my Goodreads profile</a>.</li>
            <li><em>Favorite fiction</em>: Most of the Tolkien legendarium, <em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson's stuff, Phillip Pullman's <em>His Dark Materials</em>. Yes, my favorite genre is high fantasy. I also like Haruki Murakami's writing style.</li>
            <li><em>Favorite comic EVER:</em> <a href="http://www.giantitp.com">The Order of the Stick</a>. Smart humor, occassional geeky references and great character development. The first 100+ strips aren't that great, but it gets good quickly after that.</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h3>Gear</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Camera</em>: Olympus XZ-1. <em>f</em>/1.8 lens = great low-light shots. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li><em>Laptop</em>: Sony Vaio SA35. Light and powerful, but annoyingly enough, no combo headphone/mic jack.</li>
            <li><em>Phone</em>: Motorola Moto X, version 1. Android is all right; I prefer Windows Phone. Active Display is genius.</li>
            <li><em>Sadly retired phone</em>: Nokia Lumia 800. [Died of a brutal fall off a bike that resulted in impact exactly perpendicular to the screen, rendering the display unusable.] The Windows Phone OS is gorgeous, responsive, and meets all my phone needs* without any fuss at all. This thing was incredibly durable: I dropped my phone on the floor at least three times a week and also completely submerged the phone in water (with the power on) with no issues. Immediately before time of death it only had two barely-visible scratches on the screen. </li>
            <li><em>Kindle</em>: The now-discontinued Kindle Keyboard (called the Kindle 3 at the time I got it). Ask me why I love it!</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I am currently a member of the <a href="http://www.yalegleeclub.org/">Yale Glee Club</a>, and used to sing with the Hwa Chong Choir and Hwa Chong Voices. <a href="http://yalegleeclub.org/current_season/tours">Come see us sing in Spain in Spring 2015!</a> Past tours: Cuba in Spring 2014; China and Hong Kong in Summer 2013. </li>
            <li><em>Favorite music</em>: Debussy, Lorde, Coldplay, Florence+the Machine, Debussy, Beethoven, big band, most kinds of jazz really.</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <h3>Games &amp; Other Entertainment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I like watching people play video games. Whoever started the Let's Play trend has my eternal gratitude for allowing me to vicariously play games I'd never be able to complete otherwise. I also like playing video games and being terrible at them.</li>
            <li><em>Currently playing</em>: Pokemon X/SoulSilver <a href="http://my.lotro.com/referral/Saeyan">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> - look for <em>Cedia</em> or <em>Sissal</em> on Elendilmir, and <em>Deorcwen</em> on Laurelin (the European roleplaying server).</li>
            <li><em>Other games I sometimes play</em>: Assassin's Creed II + III, The Sims, Civilization V, Torchlight, Settlers of Catan</li>
            <li><em>TV</em>: I enjoy Sherlock (the BBC one), Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, and Fullmetal Alchemist. </li>
            <li><em>Periodicals</em>: <a href="www.wired.com">WIRED</a> used to be great, but then their 2013 editorial shift happened.</li>
        </ul>
<br><br>
  <p>
        <small>* Namely - SMS (text), calling, email, contact and calendar management with good cloud synchronization, decent camera, and basic apps: messaging, Facebook, fitness tracking, Instagrammy camera filters, Skype, virtual piano.</small>
